# Pentest-Training-CTF
The pentest training lab has been built using a mixture of public sourced, vulnerable by design, Linux VMs. The Linux side of the lab will hold largely CTF and Boot2Root style machines as well as specific training applications.  Also, the lab sports a custom built and designed Windows domain environment. This is designed to mimic a typical customer's Windows based domain including standard workstations and common servers such as;      Domain Controller     Application Server     File Servers     Outdated operating systems
